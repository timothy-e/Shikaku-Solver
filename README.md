# Shikaku-Solver
For a CS final assignment, I made a program that uses backtracking to find a solution to Shikaku puzzles

Shikaku puzzles give a grid with numbers scattered throughout. The user must cover the entire grid with rectangles, with the following limtations:
  - Each rectangle must have exactly one number in it
  - Each rectangle must have area equal to the number inside
 
If the entire grid is covered, the player wins. This program solves the puzzle, producing a proper answer.
